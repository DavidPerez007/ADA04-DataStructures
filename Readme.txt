How to compile the programs?
Every folder has its own main file where we can try every linked list.

Steps to run any main
1. Locate in the root folder ADA04_E16
2. Choose the linked list you want to try
3. Type in the terminal the next script "cd <folder_name>" (you should replace <folder_name> with the name of the folder of the linked list you want to try)
4. To compile, run the next command "javac <Testing*.java>" (you should replace <Testing*.java> with the name of the testing class of the folder (these begin with the word "Testing"))
5. To test the program run "java <Testing*>" (you should replace <Testing*> with the name of the testing class you just compiled)
6. Enjoy!
